# AOC 2020
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020) for 2020, or some of it at least

## Goals

My only goal is to have fun, this means:

* if I fall behind I'm not going to stress to catch up,
* not trying to impress anyone, but do have friends taking part - 
  [swaits](https://git.sr.ht/~swaits/aoc2020/tree/master) and 
  [Jenn](https://github.com/jenndox),
* not optimizing, well not for speed or other efficiency,
* want it to be readable for sure,
* will try to make it idiomatic Racket and modular although I'll probably fail,
* it would be nice if it's elegant, but *not* baroque,
